# knobs_web_control_audio

This is a first test to integrate the nice controls from  https://github.com/g200kg/webaudio-controls to my python apps created with panel holoviz. 

Please note that the bidirectional communication between python and js is done with a dummy slider wich it can be set to invisible in th fron end.
